# Contours
# The biggest contour *should* be the sky. This is a good heuristic. If bc of the angle the sky is divided into 2,
# then the biggest contour should still be the sky. Water might sometimes be larger, in which case we can distinguish
# from sky by position in the image

# It might help to do a noise reduction
# It might help to do a sharpening after the binarization & blur

## Surf
# So ok maybe orientation not necessary, but at the beginning let's give it a shot

- make sure surf.extended = True to get all 128 features

# ORB, just because it's being used

MAYBE find some features, find the moment of the different skyscrapers, make the crop there
